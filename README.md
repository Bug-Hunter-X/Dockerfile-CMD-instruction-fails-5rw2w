This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: the CMD instruction failing because the specified start script is missing in the package.json.  The original Dockerfile uses `CMD [ "npm", "start" ]` but there's no "start" script defined in the package.json, resulting in a failure to run the container. The fixed version addresses this by adding a "start" script to package.json.
